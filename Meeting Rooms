Given an array arr[][] such that arr[i][0] is the starting time of ith meeting and arr[i][1] is the ending time of ith meeting, the task is to check if it is possible for a person to attend all the meetings such that he can attend only one meeting at a particular time.
Note: A person can attend a meeting if its starting time is greater than or equal to the previous meeting's ending time.
TC=O(nlongn) SC=O(logn)(stack space)

bool canAttend(vector<vector<int>> &arr) {
        // Your Code Here
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
        return a[0] < b[0];
    });
    for(int i=0;i<arr.size()-1;i++){
        if(arr[i][1]>arr[i+1][0]){
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
    }
